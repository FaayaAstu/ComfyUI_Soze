# ComfyUI_Soze
 Quality of Life ComfyUI Nodes built for myself, I will document once testing is complete.

 Feel free to use and submit issues.

Nodes are primarily additions to existing nodes to allow passthrough for filenames and a streamlining of batching images.  Also a CSV reader to batch prompts or other paramters from a CSV file.

All respect to the original creators, if any of them find this repo and would like a PR for these features in the nodes I have created these from, contact me and I am happy to transfer these customizations to the original owners.
